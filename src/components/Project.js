            Winner of Mint Bean's Hackathon, Sokowars is a Star Wars themed desktop Sokoban game that I made in 1 week with my wonderful hackathon team: Java the Hut. The application had to be a front end web application, with no backend or server components.
            </p>
            <p>
            The project gave me a much better understanding of how to use TypeScript and better utilize open-source frameworks for developing applications. It was so much fun watching our app come together! I'm incredibly proud of my team. Not only because of the application we produced, but for the amazing culture we formed along the way.
